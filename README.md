I'm a professional software developer, writer, presenter, father, husband, and Geek. For the last 15 years (or so), I focused on enterprise mobility and building mobile apps. My work is in 8 books, plus a lot of magazine articles and blog posts. I wrote seven books outright, and the other is an anthology of magazine articles I (and others) wrote for a particular publication. All but one of my books are on web and mobile software development. My latest publication is [Learning Progressive Web Apps](https://learningpwa.com).

**I'm happiest when writing code.**

This is my personal GitHub account, anything I say or do here is my own, personal work.

I'm currently a Principal Product Manager at [Oracle](https://oracle.com).

I love tinkering with IoT, building and writing about projects for Arduino, Particle Photon, Raspberry Pi, and more.

* Source code for each of my technology books.
