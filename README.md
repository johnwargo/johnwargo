# About Me

I'm a professional software developer, writer, presenter, father, husband, and Geek. For the last 15 years (or so), I focused on enterprise mobility and building mobile apps. I am currently a Staff Product Manager at GitHub.

This is the GitHub account for my public persona (@johnwargo); you can find my GitHub employee repo at [@jwargo](https://github.com/jwargo).

My work is in 8 books, plus a lot of magazine articles and blog posts. I wrote seven books, and the other is an anthology of magazine articles I (and others) wrote for a particular publication. All but one of my books are on web and mobile software development. My latest publication is [Learning Progressive Web Apps](https://learningpwa.com).

I love tinkering with IoT, building and writing about projects for Arduino, Particle Photon, Raspberry Pi, and more.

I'm happiest when I'm writing code.

What you'll find here is the following:

* Source code for my technology books (link to book tag list)
* Source code supporting many of my blog posts or published articles (link to list)
* Projects for Arduino (including its variants like Adafruit Feather, Particle Photon, ESP32, etc.), Raspberry Pi, Tessell 2, and who knows what else
* Follow-along source code for my public presentations
* Source code for the [`npm` modules](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/johnwargo/packages) I published
* Source code for some little Delphi utilities I created (link to tagged list)
